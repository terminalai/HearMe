## Problem Definition

**Problem Statement**: How might we improve the experience of phone calls for people with hearing loss?

### The Problem
Most businesses still operate via phone calls for immediate resolutions. For example, one would call a restaurant for a reservation, banks may call with urgent security alerts, customer service might call when the repair is completed, and so on. However, a hard-of-hearing person may not be able to understand the phone conversations accurately due to their loss of hearing. How can we use technology to reduce misunderstandings in a phone conversation? The ideal solution would be affordable and accessible to all types of sensorineural hearing loss.

### The Community
Hearing loss is defined as being partially or completely unable to hear sounds in one or both ears. While there are numerous causes that lead to hearing loss, they can happen from birth (congenital) or from external causes (acquired). Every hearing loss is unique, and commonly categorized into one of these four categories: mild hearing loss, moderate hearing loss, severe hearing loss or profound hearing loss. ([ref](https://sadeaf.org.sg/about-deafness/introduction/))

In Singapore, research has showed that about 0.1% (or 1 of every 1,000) babies born in Singapore have severe or profound hearing loss, and about 0.5% (or 5 of every 1,000) have lesser degrees of hearing loss. As the second fastest ageing nation in Asia after Japan, age-related hearing loss is becoming very common in our population. About 50% of those 80 years and above is expected to have significant hearing loss. In total, it is estimated that 360,000, or 1 in 11 Singaporeans have hearing loss.

## Proposed Solution
Phone call conversations may often be hard to make out due to poor reception, background noise and for the hard-of-hearing, This may adversely affect careers requiring consistent communications with clients or colleagues, inhibit conversations with friends and relatives and even delay the call for urgent aid from emergency services or family. To address this issue, we want to create a software that will perform Speech-To-Text on the caller's voice. It will be displayed to the deaf user, to read (while still being able to  listen to the call for those that are partially deaf. We wish to also make use of real-time noise suppression and clarity enhancing machine learning algorithms in improving the audio fidelity of calls. We plan to integrate these features into a mobile app which interfaces with the phone’s native calling functionality.
